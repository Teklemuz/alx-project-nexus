Documentation hub for major learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.

## Overview
This repository documents my major learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program. The goal is to understand key concepts, tools, and best practices from the program.

## Key Technologies Covered
- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building static and dynamic websites with server-side rendering.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code safety and developer experience.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, offering a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST.
- **API Integration**: Understanding how to connect frontend applications to backend services, retrieve, and manage data.
- **System Design & Analysis**: Designing scalable systems and understanding the intricacies of frontend architecture.
- **Semantic HTML**: Writing HTML code with proper tags to enhance accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.
- **Consuming RESTful APIs**: Integrating REST APIs with frontend applications to fetch and display data dynamically.
- **GraphQuest**: A query-building tool for GraphQL APIs that simplifies API interactions.
- **Advanced Routing Techniques**: Exploring routing strategies in React, such as dynamic routes, nested routes, and programmatic navigation.
- **Advanced TypeScript**: Diving deep into TypeScript features like generics, decorators, and advanced types to write scalable, type-safe code.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques in CSS for creating flexible and responsive web designs.
- **Wireframing and Prototyping using Figma**: Using Figma to design and prototype user interfaces before implementation.
- **CSS Preprocessors (SASS/SCSS)**: Utilizing SASS/SCSS to streamline writing CSS with variables, mixins, and nested selectors.
- **Mastering Progressive Web Applications (PWA)**: Building fast, reliable, and installable web apps that offer native app-like experiences.
- **Mobile Development with React Native**: Creating cross-platform mobile applications with React Native for iOS and Android.
- **Introduction and Advanced TypeScript**: Exploring the fundamentals and advanced features of TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Important Frontend Development Concepts
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Developing web apps that behave like native mobile apps, including offline capabilities and push notifications.
- **State Management**: Using tools like Redux, React Context, and others to handle state in complex applications.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Ensuring websites are mobile-friendly by adjusting layouts and content according to screen sizes.
